# EarthInBeatsPlayer
Media player with cool graphic interface and elements of social media, developed on C++ WinRT and C# UWP with using MF, xAudio2 and DirectX12.<br>
The main feature is the 3D model of the Earth rendered on the main screen and rotating during music playback. And the social component is displaying<br>
geotags on the planet that mark the approximate locations of people listening to the same track/album/artist (depending on your settings).<br>
This will allow you to find people with similar musical interests and get to know each other.<br>
