# WIP

# EarthInBeatsPlayer
Media player with social media elements for the Microsoft Store, featuring a graphical interface and user interaction based on a 3D Earth model. Developed using C++/WinRT and C# UWP, leveraging Media Foundation, XAudio2, and DirectX12.<br>
The main feature is the 3D model of the Earth rendered on the main screen and rotating during music playback. And the social component is displaying geotags on the planet that mark the approximate locations of people listening to the same track/album/artist (depending on your settings).<br>
This will allow you to find people with similar musical interests and get to know each other.<br>
